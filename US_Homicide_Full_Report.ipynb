    "### Author's Foreword\n",
    "It is hard to talk about this subject. It is for exactly that reason we decided to tackle it and learn from it. Even though this is an analytical report, it is good to note that all of these crimes (that should not happen) have a sometimes complex story behind it, for which our analysis cannot incorparete. So, let's get started shall we.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "The goal of this report is to learn in detail about the history of US homocides and its trends. Later on the report will focus on 1 district, Hartford County, CT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report aims to answer the following:\n",
    "- How is the homicide data correlated?\n",
    "- Are there more perpetrators than victims?\n",
    "- What is the most common weapon used in homicides?\n",
    "- What relationship result in most murders from 1980-2014?\n",
    "- What victim relationship result in most murders from 1980-2014?\n",
    "- What relationship group has the most homicides?\n",
    "- Perpetrator and victim sex distribution for each race?\n",
    "- What is the age group distribution for each race?\n",
    "- What perpetrator and victim race has the highest homicide incidences?\n",
    "- What age group is the most predominent for perpetrators and victims?\n",
    "- Has the age distribution changed over the years?\n",
    "- What ages encompass the most perpetrators? \n",
    "- What states have the lowest homicide rate in 2014?\n",
    "- What states have the highest homicide rate in 2014?\n",
    "- What states have the lowest number of incidences from 1980-2014?\n",
    "- What states have the highest number of incidences from 1980-2014?\n",
    "- Has the homocide rate decreased from 1980-2014?\n",
    "- What events caused homicide rates to decrease?\n",
    "- Can we predict whether the crime will be solved or unsolved for victims?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report Steps\n",
    "This report consists of 4 major parts:\n",
    "1. Data Exploration\n",
    "    - Overview and understanding of the data\n",
    "    - Finding Errors\n",
    "2. Data Cleaning\n",
    "    - Clean the data and prepare it for viziulization\n",
    "    - Expect an extensive cleaning operation\n",
    "3. Subsetting & viziulization\n",
    "    - For the US  \n",
    "4. Decision Trees\n",
    "    - Encode data\n",
    "    - Decision tree model\n",
    "4. Application to a specific scenario\n",
    "    - Analysis of homicide data for Hartford, Connecticut\n",
    "    - Hartford Police and education department competing for a fictional $1,000,000 grant to reduce its homicide rate \n",

Then we specify how big the lineplot is going to be with plt.figure and plot a seaborn chart specifying the data and what columns to use on the axis (x is categorical, y is numeric). The title is set by using .set_title() method for seaborn. Lastly, we use matplotlib axvspan to highligh the events on the plot.
